# dotfiles?

[Dotfiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_file_and_hidden_directory#Unix_and_Unix-like_environments) are hidden files often used to configure applications and various system settings. This repo contains my own dotfiles, currently based around [Pop_OS!](https://pop.system76.com/) Linux. For a general introduction to dotfiles, check out [GitHub does dotfiles](https://dotfiles.github.io/). My dotfiles are the result of years of tweaking and constantly changing things. It works for me, but may not work for you. Thus, review the code and remove things you donâ€™t want or need. **Do not** blindly use my dotfiles or run `install.sh` unless you know exactly what your are doing.

I will likely switch to [Debian Sid](https://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/unofficial/non-free/cd-including-firmware/weekly-builds/amd64/iso-cd/) shortly.

# Quick install

The easiest way to get started is to clone this repo and running `install.sh`:
