# dotfiles?

[Dotfiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_file_and_hidden_directory#Unix_and_Unix-like_environments) are hidden files often used to configure applications and various system settings. This repo contains my own dotfiles, currently based on [Pop_OS!](https://pop.system76.com/) Linux. For a general introduction to dotfiles, check out [GitHub does dotfiles](https://dotfiles.github.io/). :warning: **This repo is slowly but surely being re-built.** Use anything you find here with caution.

## Installation

The easiest way to get started is to clone this repo and running `install.sh`:
