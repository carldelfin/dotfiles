## dotfiles?

[Dotfiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_file_and_hidden_directory#Unix_and_Unix-like_environments) are hidden files often used to configure applications and various system settings. This repo contains my own dotfiles, currently based around [Debian Testing](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianTesting), as well as scripts for automatically getting my machines up and running after a clean OS install. For a general introduction to dotfiles, check out [GitHub does dotfiles](https://dotfiles.github.io/). Note that my dotfiles are the result of years of constant tweaking and tinkering. They work for me, but may not work for you. Thus, review the code and remove things you donâ€™t want or need. [Do not fork](https://www.anishathalye.com/2014/08/03/managing-your-dotfiles/) my dotfiles or run `build.sh` unless you know what your are doing.
