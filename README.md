# dotfiles?

[Dotfiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_file_and_hidden_directory#Unix_and_Unix-like_environments) are hidden files often used to configure applications and various system settings. This repo contains my own dotfiles, currently based around [Debian Testing](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianTesting). For a general introduction to dotfiles, check out [GitHub does dotfiles](https://dotfiles.github.io/). My own dotfiles are the result of years of tweaking and constantly changing things. They work for me, but may not work for you. Thus, review the code and remove things you donâ€™t want or need. **Do not** blindly use my dotfiles or run `build.sh` unless you know what your are doing.

# Quick install

The easiest way to get started is to clone this repo and running `build.sh`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/carldelfin/dotfiles.git && cd dotfiles && bash build.sh
```
