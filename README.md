# dotfiles

[Dotfiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_file_and_hidden_directory#Unix_and_Unix-like_environments) are hidden files often used to configure applications and various system settings. This repo contains my own dotfiles, currently based on [Pop_OS!](https://pop.system76.com/) Linux. For a general introduction to dotfiles, check out [Github does dotfiles](https://dotfiles.github.io/).
