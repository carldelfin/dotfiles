ChatGPT: 

> Dotfiles are files that are typically hidden on Unix-like operating systems, denoted by a leading dot (e.g., ".bashrc", ".vimrc", etc.), hence the name "dotfiles". These files store configuration settings and customization options for various command-line tools, text editors, and other software applications. Dotfiles are usually written in plain text and contain settings such as aliases, environment variables, color schemes, keybindings, and other preferences that personalize the behavior of software on a user's system.
